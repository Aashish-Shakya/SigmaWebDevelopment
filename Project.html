Great progress! Based on the topics you’ve completed — which cover **HTML fundamentals, basic media, forms, semantic tags, and a bit of SEO** — here are some **project ideas** you can build **using only HTML (and minimal CSS if you know a bit of it)**.

### 3. 📬 **Contact Form Page**

**What to include:**

### 4. 📚 **HTML Cheatsheet**

**What to include:**

## 📌 Bonus: Add These to Any Project

* Validate your HTML using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Let me know if:

* You've also started CSS (so we can improve UI)
* You want GitHub push steps or folder structure
* You want one project to be fully guided step-by-step

Would you like me to pick **one project and walk you through it next**?
